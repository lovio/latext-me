#Latex-me
***
I wrote my resume in Latex using a template called *moderncv* .
There are two version of my resume.One is in English,the other one is in Chinese.I used a photo taken when I arrived in Zhunyi,Guizhou.But when I printed this resume,this photo seems too dark and I look old and dull.So next time I'll use a more handsome photo.  
Good luck!
